# ecs-scholarship-application
Uses PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS to create a form that will take and validate the user's input, and then convert all the entered information into a PDF saved on the server. The user is then redirected to this PDF which they can download and send to the scholarship committee.

### NOTE: Made on 9/27/2014, early on in my web development career. 
This scholarship application serves now as a learning mechanism and archival of code. If this application were to be remade, it would use the MVC model with a more secure approach.
