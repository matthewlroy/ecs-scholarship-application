# ecs-scholarship-application
### High-level description of this web application
Uses PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS to create forms asking questions related to contact information and educational information. This information will then be validated and converted into a PDF saved on the server (currently saves the PDF in a folder -> ./apps). The user is then redirected to this PDF which they can download and send to the scholarship committee.

### NOTE: Made on 4/21/2015, early on in my web development career
This scholarship application now serves as a learning mechanism and archival of code. If this application were to be remade, it would use the MVC (model-view-controller) model with a more secure approach.
